# Ceph-quickstarts
Ceph  an open-source software-defined storage platform Quickstarts.

## Intro
- Ceph == software-defined storage (SDS)
- Provides unified software-defined solutions for: 
    - block
    - file
    - object
- Distributed storage sys
- Massively scalable
- High performing
- No single point of faulure
- Exabyte and beyond
- Run on general commodity hardware
- Is a true SDS solution

## Architectual philosophy
- All component must scale linearly
- There should not be any single point of failure
- The solutions must be software-based, open source, and adaptable
- The Ceph software should run on readily available commodity hardware
- Every component must be self-managing and self-healing wherever possible

> Object storage is the perfect provision for current and future needs for unstructured data storage.

> In Ceph objects are not tied to a physical path, making objects locations idependent.

## Software-defined storage -- SDS
- SDS helps with TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
- Benefits: 
    - Flexibility
    - Scalability
    - Reliability

## Cloud storage
- Cloud platform support: 
    - OpenStack
    - Apache CloudStack
    - OpenNebula

## Vendor support
- RedHat
- Canonical
- Mirantis
- SUSE
- etc
